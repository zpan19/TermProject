Project Proposal: DIY PC Builder & Online Store

1. Project Objective
    The objective of this project is to develop an online PC builder and e-commerce website that allows 
    users to customize their own computers by selecting different hardware components, including CPU, GPU, 
    motherboard, power supply, memory, and storage. The system will dynamically calculate the total price based 
    on the selected components and provide a shopping cart and checkout functionality.

2. Project Scope & Goals

    2.1 Purpose of the Website
        Provide users with an interactive platform to build and purchase custom PCs based on their needs and budget.
        Enable customers to select compatible components and get an estimated price before purchasing.
        Offer a smooth and intuitive shopping experience with a shopping cart and order summary.

    2.2 Target Audience
        PC enthusiasts looking to customize high-performance computers.
        Gamers and content creators in need of custom PC configurations.
        General consumers looking to build PCs for work, gaming, or productivity.

    2.3 Key Features and Functionalities

        2.3.1 PC Component Selection
            Users can choose from various CPU, GPU, motherboard, RAM, power supply, and storage options.
            Display technical specifications and prices for each component.

        2.3.2 Real-Time Price Calculation
            The total price updates dynamically as users select or modify components.

        2.3.3 Compatibility Check (Optional)
            Prevent users from selecting incompatible parts (e.g., AMD CPU with Intel motherboard).

        2.3.4 Shopping Cart & Order Summary
            Users can add/remove items from the cart and view their final PC build.
            Display an order summary before checkout.

        2.3.5 User Management (Optional in First Phase)
            Users can register/login to save PC builds and track orders.

        2.3.6 Database Storage
            Store available PC components, customer orders, and shopping cart data.

        2.3.7 Checkout Process (Future Enhancement)
            Allow users to place orders (payment system integration for later phase).

3. Technical Requirements

    3.1 Front-End Development
        Technologies: HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), JavaScript
        UI Design: Simple and intuitive PC building interface, Interactive shopping cart and live price updates.

    3.2 Back-End Development
        Technologies: PHP & MySQL
        Database Design:
            Products Table – Stores available PC components and prices.
            Cart Table – Tracks items added to the cart.
            Orders Table – Stores finalized purchases.

        Functionality:
            Fetch and display product data.
            Handle user interactions and store selections in the database.
            Implement price calculations dynamically.

    3.3 Integration & Testing
        Ensure front-end and back-end are properly connected.
        Test the price calculation system for accuracy.
        Check the shopping cart functionality for usability and efficiency.

    3.4 Deployment
        Use XAMPP or LAMP for local hosting during development.
        Future deployment options include cloud hosting solutions.

4. Project Deliverables
    Fully functional online PC builder & store.
    Shopping cart with real-time price calculation.
    GitHub repository with documented source code.
